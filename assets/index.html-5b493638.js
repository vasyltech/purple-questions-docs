Our discovery has led us to adopt an alternative approach that is both straightforward and remarkably efficient."},{"title":"Cost-Effective","details":"We are firmly convinced that, given the current affordability of commoditized large language models like OpenAI, the cost of handling an average customer support request should be approximately one cent. We have already demonstrated the validity of this assertion."},{"title":"You Own Your Data","details":"You possess ownership of all the trained materials and operational data, including vectors, indexed conversations, and more. These assets can be conveniently stored on your local computer or a GitHub repository in a straightforward and comprehensible manner. By doing so, in the event that you decide to transition to another platform, you won't incur additional costs for embedding and content analysis."},{"title":"Handle Complex Requests","details":"Responding to support requests using pre-trained materials constitutes only a portion of the broader custom support framework. Addressing support inquiries that necessitate the retrieval of supplementary information, such as subscription status, license details, or integration with third-party services, is categorically labeled as \\"escalation\\" to human intervention. We firmly believe that this facet can also be automated, and we possess the expertise to accomplish it effectively."},{"title":"Minimize Dependencies","details":"A major goal in our overarching research endeavor is to reduce reliance on external services. To illustrate, our knowledge vector repository is founded on LanceDB, a persistent file storage system that can be easily accessible locally or hosted within serverless instances like AWS Lambda. You can execute the entire training procedure on your laptop using a user-friendly desktop application and deploy pre-trained data to any location within seconds."},{"title":"Custom User Experience","details":"Are you growing weary of encountering the familiar \\"question bubble\\" that appears in the lower right corner, heralding the arrival of a user-friendly chatbot? While this may offer an appealing visual experience, it may not consistently align with your specific requirements. We are committed to breaking free from the confines of a run-of-the-mill customer support user interface, opting instead for an API-first approach. This empowers you to craft your own tailored experience or tap into our pre-built solutions as needed."}]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Motivation & Behind-Scene Story","slug":"motivation-behind-scene-story","link":"#motivation-behind-scene-story","children":[]}],"git":{"updatedTime":1695141881000,"contributors":[{"name":"Vasyl Martyniuk","email":"vasyl@vasyltech.com","commits":1}]},"filePathRelative":"index.md"}`);export{e as data};
